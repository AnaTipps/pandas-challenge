# pandas-challenge
In this assignment, I was asked to create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze different schools and standardized test data.

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I created a report that includes the following data. 

# District School Summary 

including the following key metrics:

Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

# A School Summary
Where I created a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school, include the following:

School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

# Shool performance 
Top 5 schools with the higher Overall Passin rates on maths and reading.

As well as the bottom 5 schools with the lowest Overall Passin rates on maths and reading.


# A Math Scores by Grade
Where I created a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

# Same for the Reading Scores by Grade 
I created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

# Scores by School Spending
Another dataFrame was created which breaked down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

# Spending_summary.

I created a summary of spending that includeed the following metrics in the table:

Average math score
Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

# Scores by School Size
I created a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

# Scores by School Type

This DataFrame shows school performance based on the "School Type".
